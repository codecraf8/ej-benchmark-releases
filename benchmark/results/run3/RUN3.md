# Final benchmark, run 3: ej 1.0.1 (2026-10-08) — licence fix of the withdrawn v1.0.0; same architecture

ej 1.0.1 is the v1.0.0 code refitted on the licence-clean training pool v2b, with the low-bit encoder re-distilled on v2b
texts (state `3b3e66d28fb423f9`). It was scored once on the final test suites, including zs_wide final, which was read for
the first time in this run; nothing was selected on it. Scoring: the research evaluator (same `check` / `rows` / `summary`
as `benchmark/scoring.py`) plus record-cluster bootstrap CIs (1,000 draws) and the ECE floor of a perfectly calibrated
model (500 draws). Files: `ej-1.0.1.all-suites.json` (all aggregates of the run) and `ej-1.0.1.vs-rivals.paired.json`
(paired differences). Aggregates only: no per-record predictions, no suite inputs.

## ej 1.0.1 per suite

| suite | records / questions | NLL [95% CI] | micro acc [95% CI] | ECE15 [95% CI] | ECE floor q95 → calibrated? | CA coverage / error (this suite only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| zs_massive | 1,000 / 1,000 | .4811 [.4297, .5302] | .8320 [.8080, .8570] | .0507 [.0405, .0731] | .0395 → no | .798 / .080 |
| tickets | 169 / 507 | .6291 [.5830, .6804] | .7120 [.6785, .7456] | .0334 [.0284, .0800] | .0607 → **yes** | 0 (no threshold certified) |
| tickets_ood | 147 / 441 | .7152 [.6503, .7871] | .6825 [.6394, .7256] | .0500 [.0391, .0991] | .0716 → **yes** | 0 (no threshold certified) |
| zs_wide | 1,764 / 3,702 | 1.1963 [1.1763, 1.2195] | .4217 [.4046, .4385] | .1214 [.1083, .1373] | .0274 → no | 0 (no threshold certified) |

"Calibrated" = observed ECE15 at or below the 95th percentile (q95) of a perfectly calibrated model's ECE15 at the same
confidences. Certified automation (CA) holds for that suite only. Mean NLL over td, zs_td, zs_massive and tickets: .7297.

**Unseen workflows (zs_wide final, 147 workflows never trained on).** Group-macro accuracy over the real sources
(macro_real; SNI, SGD and ABCD weighted equally, 105 workflows; Welch-Satterthwaite t interval over workflows within
sources): **.4187 [.3791, .4584]**; SNI .4557 [.4018, .5096] (79 workflows), SGD .5713 [.5286, .6140] (22), ABCD .2292
[.1022, .3561] (4). GLM-synthetic workflows, reported separately (their labels are not independently checked): .3583
[.3230, .3936] (42 workflows). No rival was run on zs_wide.

## Rivals (sealed runs of 2026-10-07, the five original final suites)

The rival rows are the run-2 page's rival files (`../run2/<suite>.<rival>.summary.json`; the suites are unchanged).
Contamination and fairness flags: `../../METHOD.md` (laya, Julia-1 and Jev likely saw the zs_td workflow; the tickets
suites are ej's home turf; Jev's probabilities are rounded to 2 decimals).

Paired differences, ej 1.0.1 minus rival (record-cluster bootstrap over the suite's records, 2,000 draws; each rival's
accuracy and NLL recomputed from the pairing equal its sealed summary). An ordering is stated only where the CI excludes 0.

**Reading.** td: micro accuracy below laya, level with Jev and Julia-1, above kev-0.8b, OpenThai-SystemOne and
gliclass-edge v3.0. zs_td (one workflow, selected on, see below): micro accuracy below all six rivals. zs_massive: below
Jev, laya, kev-0.8b and OpenThai-SystemOne, above Julia-1 and gliclass-edge v3.0. tickets / tickets_ood (in-house): NLL
lower than every rival. No latency, size or calibration ranking is made: rival latencies were measured on another day
under unrecorded load (not comparable).

## Variability and selection

Six fits of the same code and data with different seeds (development suites) give a between-seed SD of .0105 in the mean
development NLL, .019 in zs_wide development macro_real and .037 in zs_td development micro accuracy. This release is the
default seed, fixed before fitting. Differences of that size between fits, or between 1.0.1 and the withdrawn 1.0.0
(run 2), are not evidence of a better or worse model.

zs_td is ONE held-out workflow (security_incidents; dev 300 and final 100 records of the same workflow). v1.0.0 was kept on
its dev accuracy (A-025) after ~55 logged comparisons on it, so final zs_td estimates accuracy on further records of a
workflow the model was selected on: it is neither unbiased nor unseen-workflow evidence. Its fit-to-fit SD (same code,
other RNG) is ~.022 accuracy per fit (SD of a difference .031, 4 pairs), twice its record-cluster SE (.011); one workflow
gives no between-workflow variance. Unseen-workflow evidence = zs_wide final macro_real.

Latency (one record per call, one torch thread): README "Latency" and `../latency-r21/`.
